### **FLASHING INSTRUCTIONS**

#### **PREREQUISITES**
In order to be able to flash both the bootloader and the HID2AMI app, you need:
- A MS-Windows or Linux PC
- An A-A USB cable (https://www.google.com/search?q=a-a+usb+cable)
- for Windows: the free ST DFU Tools. Download the package from here (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32080.html)
- for Linux: the free dfu-util from http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net.

### **FLASHING IN LINUX**
Thanks to the precious & talented friend Sukkopera (https://github.com/SukkoPera), HID2AMI App can be flashed within a Linux environment as well as its Windows counterpart. You can find the detailed procedure here: [Sukkopera's Linux Flashing instructions](https://github.com/EmberHeavyIndustries/HID2AMI/blob/master/Docs/hid2ami_linux.md)
Thank you SukkoPera !

### **FLASHING IN WINDOWS**

#### **FLASHING THE BOOTLOADER**
- Install the ST DFU Tool package on your Windows machine. Make sure you have the ST DFU-USB driver installed (in case something went wrong, you can manually install them from the DFU Tool's directory)
- Set HID2AMI in DFU-BOOT mode, by selecting position 2-3 for both "BOOT0" and "PA9BOOT" jumpers
- MAKE SURE THAT HID2AMI IS NOT CONNECTED TO YOUR AMIGA MOUSE/JOY PORT
- Connect HID2AMI to any USB port of your PC, by mean of the A-A USB Cable
- After few seconds, HID2AMI should be recognized by Windows as "ST Device in DFU Mode"
- Launch "DfuSeDemo" App from ST Tools package. You should see a form like this one, showing your HID2AMI has booted in DFU mode and has been recognized properly

- Select the HID2AMIBOOTLOADER.dfu file you previosly downloaded from [here](https://github.com/EmberHeavyIndustries/HID2AMI/blob/master/Firmware/HID2AMIBOOTLOADER.dfu) by pressing "Choose" under "Upgrade or Verify Action". 
You should come to a condition like this

- Press "Upgrade" button and wait the process to finish with success.

#### **RETRIEVING YOUR PERSONAL BOARD CODE**
If everything went fine, your board now can boot from the BOOTLOADER and is ready to be loaded with the HID2AMI App
- Set HID2AMI in BOOTLOADER mode, by selectin position 1-2 for "BOOT0" and position 2-3 for "PA9BOOT". **Note: newer Rev1.1 preassembled boards do not have BOOT0 jumper installed, since it is not needed to update the App. If it is your case, simply ignore BOOT0**
- MAKE SURE THAT HID2AMI IS NOT CONNECTED TO YOUR AMIGA MOUSE/JOY PORT
- Connect HID2AMI to any USB port of your PC, by mean of the A-A USB Cable: the bootloader should take control, and you should see the activity led on board (lower led near usb connector) fastly blinking
- Look at DfuSeDemo window: you should see something like as follows. Note down the four characters you see near "Version" field

- In order to get a properly signed app, working tied to your board, you have to ask it from the author, by sending him an [email](mailto:EmberHEavyIndustries@gmail.com) together with your personal code, which is the four character as above (in the case of the picture is "D530", yours should obviously be different)

#### **FLASHING THE HID2AMI APP**
- Once received your personalized app file, in the form "HID2AMIAPP.XXXX.dfu", boot again HID2AMI in BOOTLOADER mode (just as above), "Choose" the app file "HID2AMIAPP.XXXX.dfu" and press "Upgrade" 
- To boot in BOOTLOADER mode just set "PA9BOOT" jumper in position 2-3

- You're done ! Put the HID2AMI board in APP mode by by selecting position 1-2 for both "BOOT0" and "PA9BOOT" jumpers, **DISCONNECT you HID2AMI board from your Windows PC** and connect it to any Mouse/Joy port of your Amiga
- Enjoy !
