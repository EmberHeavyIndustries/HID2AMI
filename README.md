**HID2AMI** is an **HID mouse to quadrature waveform converter** and **HID Gamepad adapter** for the Amiga (and C64, Atari 7600, AtariST also..) series of boards; it allows ANY modern HID mouse (not limited to PS/2-USB) and almost ANY (*) modern digital/analog Gamepad to be connected and enjoyed with our Amiga computers.

(*) At the moment it has been tested against dozens of different gamepads,  but working for each and every existing Gamepad cannot be guaranteed; nevertheless, if you find a Pad which does not work with HID2AMI, you are encouraged to contact the author and supply him its "HID Report Descriptor" to be investigated.

## **REV 2.0 board** 

HID2AMI Rev. 2.0 board (released in Autumn 2022) upgrades previous versions by adding capability of supporting Mousewheel and CD32 protocols, in a smaller compact shape.

Current firmware v2.0.0 act in the very same way of v1.x.x, with Mousewheel an CD32 support which will be added in future releases.

## **HOW DOES IT WORK** (in brief):

HID2AMI recognizes and manages any HID device connected to its USB interface; if the device is recognized as an HID mouse, then HID2AMI starts capturing live movements and button pressings of the peripheral, then converting both of them into proper quadrature waveforms (and Amiga mouse button pressings) which can be properly understood by the Amiga itself, as if a real quadrature "Amiga" mouse was connected.

If the device is recognized as an HID gamepad, then HID2AMI maps pad's controls on the Amiga Joystick port/interface.
Gamepad's buttons are mapped evenly on Amiga button1/button2/UP/DOWN (useful for jump & racing games) inputs.
Starting from fw 1.7.1 a custom mapping can be freely configured and stored for automatic retrieval upon reconnection.

There is no need to manually configure the emulation mode: device recognition and operation mode switching are automatically performed by HID2AMI itself.

## **GETTING STARTED AND USER GUIDE**:

Here you can find a quick user guide, describing basic operations and the available meta-commands for peripheral's profile customization, storage and retrieval.

[HID2AMI QUICK USER GUIDE](https://github.com/EmberHeavyIndustries/HID2AMI/blob/master/Docs/Quick.User.Guide.md)




## **COMPATIBILITY LIST**

(!) HID2AMI has been tested against a number of HID compliant Mice and Gamepads; the following compatibility list keeps track of tested peripherals. If you tested your mice/Gamepads and want to contribute to the list, simply send an email to the author with your compatibility results. In case your device is not handled properly, you can submit an HID dump to the author for investigation.

## **READ CAREFULLY BEFORE CONNECTING ANY PAD/MOUSE TO YOUR AMIGA**

 **BE AWARE** that when you connect a peripheral to the Amiga's mouse/joy port, the power supply or that peripheral comes from/through that port itself. **Be aware that improperly connecting an "high" power-demanding device could lead to overheat or even damage the Amiga joy/mouse port**. 

If you connect controllers with rechargeable batteries, **be absolutely confident that the battery has been fully charged**  **BEFORE** connecting it to the Amiga, or the charging current flowing from the joy/mouse port to your controller's battery could seriosly damage your Commodore  !

 You are usign HID2AMI at your own risk: I will either not be liable nor responsible for any damage you could cause to your hardware for any use or misuse of HID2AMI together with your systems.  


 
## **DEVELOPMENT**

HID2AMI hardware and firmware were designed, developed and maintained by **Sampedenawa** on behalf of **EmberHeavyIndustries** (an evil worldwide company, whose mission is to rule the world by the mean of reviving Amiga computers), following a discussion born on Italian www.amigapage.it Amiga forum.


## **ASSEMBLY**

 ## **WARNING !!  A COUPLE THINGS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND BEFORE GOING FURTHER**
 
 - **NEVER, NEVER, NEVER connect "both sides" of HID2AMI to a power source at the same time !**
 **This means: do not connect HID2AMI to a PC through the USB port while it is plugged into your Amiga's joy/mouse port !**
 **If you want to upgrade your HID2AMI with bootloader or DFU mode, beware to disconnect it from your Amiga first !**
 
 - **BE AWARE** that when you connect a peripheral to the Amiga's mouse/joy port, the power supply or that peripheral comes from/through that port itself. Amiga control peripheral ports were probably not designed with "mega-rumble-end-of-universe-nuclear-powered" gamepads in mind: while there is generally no risk in connecting "common" mainstream peripherals like the ones have been tested (see above), be aware that improperly connecting an "high" power-demanding device could lead to overheat or even damage the Amiga joy/mouse port. **You can consider the power consumption safety limit roughly around 100mA; exceeding this limit could be dangerous for your Amiga!.**

#### **BILL OF MATERIALS**

Components noted as "Optional" fulfil the general purpose STM32F1x reference design; generally speaking they can be safely omitted from the assembly of HID2AMI. Consider soldering any of them in case you experience some instability of any kind (never experienced so far).

LED1 is "run mode" indicator; it blinks at variable rates to indicate HID2AMI running status (suggesetd colors: green, yellow, white)
- When in BOOTLOADER mode, a fast blink means bootloader running and waiting for the "App" to be flashed/upgraded
- When in APP mode, a "regular" blinking means the App is running and waiting for input; a slower blinking (upon connecting a peripheral), means the peripheral correctly identified and mapped 

LED2 is the "power on" indicator; if lit then your board gets correct +5V and +3.3V power supply 

For both LED1 and LED2, the suggested value for their respective limiting current resistors is 10k, but you can safely experiment any value in range 1k-47k depending on the led components characteristics and light efficiency (and your personal taste)
